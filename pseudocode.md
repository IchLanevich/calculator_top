# use SOLID principle

a variable that contain firstOperand [x]
a variable that contain secondOperand [x]
a variable that contain choosen operator [x]

a func to handle choosing an operator [x]
a func to handle clear [x]
a func to where to put the clicked number to first operand or second operand [x]
a func to handle display [x]
a func to handle calculating result [x]

When user click a number, assign it as first operand
if user click another number and not an operator, combine the first selected number to the new selected number(e.g: first number 1, second number 2, it became 12);
user can only choose operator when first operand is filled
if not filled, do nothing
if first operand is filled and user has choosen an operator, allow user to fill second operand
when first operand, second operand, and operator has choosen and filled, if user click on operator button, calculate the first operand and second operand and set is as first operand and the newly clicked operator become the new choosen operator and now is time for user to fill second operand
